## Info

**aMAZEing Mine** is a game developed for the [Ludum Dare 48](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48) Game Jam with the topic *Deeper and deeper*  in a timespan of 76 hours.

The idea for this game comes from the classic board game [Labyrinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(board_game)), which allows you to alter the game field by pushing maze tiles from the sides, affecting all tiles in that row. We adapted this idea into a 2D side-scrolling game with the goal of breaking the highscore by delving as deep into the caves as possible.

The game was developed in the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org).
